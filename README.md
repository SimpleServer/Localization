SimpleServer Translations
=========================

Storing translations
--------------------
The translations can be stored in a folder called translations. The folder needs to be in same location as SimpleServer.

Adding/updating translations
----------------------------
To add new translations, you first need to get the *template.json* file. When you have the file, you just need to translate the second side of each line (e.g. "%d chests have been unlocked!" : "%d kistor har l√•sts upp!").
Tools for translation updating are coming.
